# Interactive Circle model 

I have the script (Javascript) code in the html file because that is what the website developing site wanted me to do. It had a section for this type of code but would get super buggy so I moved it into the html. Otherwise, I was able to use the css code perfectly. You can see why I moved it into a seperate file because I had a lot of styling to do. Love you dad!
